DOMAIN:FRONT END WEB DEVELOPMENT

DURATION:8 WEEKS

MENTOR:NEELA SANTOSH
DESCRIPTION:
 This project aims to demonstrate the internâ€™s ability to build dynamic and interactive web applications with live data exchange capabilities.

The core functionality of the application is to enable instant messaging between multiple users. This is achieved using WebSockets, which allow a continuous two-way communication channel between the client and server without the need for repeated HTTP requests. When one user sends a message, it should instantly appear on all connected clients in real time.

The application should feature a responsive user interface that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The chat interface must include a message display area, an input field for typing messages, and a button (or Enter key support) to send messages. It should also maintain message history** within the session so users can view past messages during the conversation.

For the backend, a simple WebSocket server built using Node.js and the `ws` library is sufficient to handle message broadcasting between clients. The frontend should be developed with clean, structured code and an emphasis on usability and design.
